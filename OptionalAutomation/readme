Optional Automation
This is for the quick creation of quake 3 servers in GCP using scripts.


1. Using GCP console, create bucket and place the following inside: 
   paks 0-8, autoexec.cfg, server.cfg, levels.cfg, bots.cfg, vmstartup.sh, instancecreation.sh, q3serverstart.sh, files.sh

2. Copy instancecreation.sh from cloud storage to cloud shell. Give it execute permissions and run it
       gsutil cp gs://<bucket path> <cloud shell path>
       chmod +x instancecreation.sh
      ./instancreation.sh
      (This should create the instance template and instance. It will also run startup scripts to update linux, install screen, and the ioq3-server package.)
      (If the template already exists, you will receive an error stating such. The second command to create the instance will still be successful if the 
      VM name specified is not the same as any existin VM's in GCP.)
    
    **** Need to figure out how to get the script to ask the user to enter a name for the VM. Currently you need to edit the script to change the vm name.
    
3. Create firewall using GCP console
      Target tag: quake-server (Using this tag assigns it to the vm instance)
      Protocols/ports: Quake3 uses udp 27960
      Source ip ranges: 0.0.0.0/0 (Anyone can connect)
    
4. SSH into VM and create password for root 
      sudo passwd

5. Create quake 3 user and password (must be root)
      useradd -m -g users -d /home/quake3 -s /bin/bash quake3
      passwd quake3
      
6. Switch to quake3 user and run server
      su - quake3
      /usr/lib/ioquake3/ioq3ded
      (The server will not run because the game files are missing but directories will still be made)
      
7. Copy files.sh from cloud storage to vm. Give execute permissions to script
      gsutil cp gs://quake3files/scripts/files.sh /home/quake3
      chmod +x files.sh
 
8. Run files.sh
      ./files.sh
      (This will copy game files and cfg's from cloud storage to proper directories.)
       
9. Run server (as quake3 user)
      SSH into VM
      Start screen session: screen -D -R
      Change user: su - quake3
      Start server: ./q3serverstart
      
      
   Extra screen commands:
   	Find out session id (screen -ls)
	Reconnect to screen (screen -r <session id>
	Terminate screen screen -X -S <session id> quit
	Detach from screen (ctrl-a + ctrl-d)
