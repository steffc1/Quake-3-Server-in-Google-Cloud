Optional Automation
These scripts can be used to quickly create quake 3 VM servers. 

The following will need to be uploaded to cloud storage
1. cfg files
2. pak files
3. scripts

The scripts will then need to be uploaded to the /home/quake3/ directory from cloud storage using the gsutil cp command (gsutil cp gs://<bucket path> /home/quake3


At this time, the only things not automated are
  1. Creating the password for root
  2. Creating the quake3 user and password
  3. Starting screen
  4. Creating firewall rules
  
For the above, refer to the creation process file.
