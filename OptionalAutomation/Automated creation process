1. Run instancecreation.sh from cloud shell (This should create the instance template and instance. It will also run startup scripts to update linux, install screen, 
   and ioq3-server)
    (If the template already exists, you will receive an error stating such. The second command to create the instance will still be successful if the 
    VM name specified is not the same as any existin VM's in GCP)
    
    **** Need to figure out how to get the script to ask the user to enter a name for the VM.
    **** Need to figure out why network tag is not being added to VM even though its specified in instance template command.
    
2. Create password for root (sudo passwd)

3. Create quake 3 user and password (must be root)
      useradd -m -g users -d /home/quake3 -s /bin/bash quake3
      passwd quake3
      
4. Switch to quake3 user
      su - quake3
      
5. Run server to create .q3a directory
      /usr/lib/ioquake3/ioq3ded
      (The server will not run because the game files are missing but directories will still be made)

6. Move uploadscripts.sh from cloud storage to vm and give execute permissions
      gsutil cp gs://quake3files/scripts/uploadscripts.sh /home/quake3/
      chmod +x uploadscripts.sh
      
7. Run uploadscripts.sh
      ./uploadscripts.sh
      
8. Give execute permissions to addexecuteperms.sh and run it
      chmod +x addexecuteperms.sh
      ./addexecuteperms.sh
      
 7. Run uploadpaks.sh  uploadservercfgs.sh
 
 8. Run server (as quake3 user)
      /usr/lib/ioquake3/ioq3ded +exec server.cfg +exec levels.cfg +exec bots.cfg
